Found a website/GitHub project to upload photo spheres to google
https://maps.moomoo.me/

Need to change the metadata of Skydio photo sphere outputs using the following code:
in miniconda, navigate to C:\Users\colte\miniconda3\pkgs\exiftool-12.76-pl5321h57928b3_0\bin

Run the following command:
exiftool -UsePanoramaViewer=true -ProjectionType=equirectangular <image\with\path.jpg>

Upload to the Photo Sphere Studio website

The sharable link from the website doesn't work (drops coords at 0, 0). Instead, the next day I just zoomed into the area of the photo sphere and hovered (with the streetview blue dots/roads turned on). If I had my cursor in the right spot it allowed me to click on the photo sphere, then I could copy the link.
